		hindi speakers are just not on the platform, or even if they
		are, they are confined to the social mediums of facebook and
		twitter. Scholars of the language are refraining to their
		old ways and not using the internet. As a result we don\'t see
		many scholarly content in Hindi. And people who are proficient
